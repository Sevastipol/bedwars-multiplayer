Bedwars is a game of strategy, the most important aspect: you respawn if your bed isn't broken.

There are 2 main ways to play the game:

1) offense - buy blocks and bridge to enemy bases to break their bed and eliminate them
2) defense - stay at your base and put blocks around your bed which make it much harder to break

**SHOP**
--------------
To open the shop, click [B] to toggle it on and off.
Once you have enough resources, click on an item which is lit up to buy it. (hint: you can see the resources you have at top left!)

Some items cannot be bought with iron, you will have to bridge out to the other islands to gain different resources.

**BRIDGING**
--------------
To bridge to different islands, you will first need blocks.
Once you have atleast 16 blocks, you can start briding to the gold island. (the island closest to you)

1) Hold shift, and go over the edge of the island. (you won't fall!) 
2) keep holding shift, and put the crosshair on the side of the block you are standing on, then right click.

3) repeat this until you are out of blocks

EMERALDS
--------------
You can buy better items with the gold you collected, but nothing beats emeralds, so the emerald island should be your next briding location.

With emeralds you can buy:
1) Enderpearl, a projectile that will teleport you to its point of impact.
2) Obsidian, the strongest block in the game, ideal for defending your bed.
3) Emerald Sword, the best weapon in the game, dealing 4 hearts of damage per hit.

Emeralds are the best resource in the game, so expect players to be there before you!


This tutorial covers the basics of my game, but there are many more aspects which you will have to learn yourself, so that you can be the ultimate player.
**Have fun playing Bedwars!**
