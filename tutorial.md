[ 2 PEOPLE REQUIRED TO START ]


Bedwars is a game of strategy, the most important aspect: you respawn if your bed isn't broken.

There are 2 main ways to play the game:
1) offense - buy blocks and bridge (with blocks) into people's bases to break their bed and eliminate them
2) defense - stay at your base and put blocks around your bed to make it much harder to break
