**[ 2 PEOPLE REQUIRED TO START ]**

Only PC support for now.

INTRODUCTION
--------------

Bedwars is a game of strategy, the most important aspect: you can respawn if your bed isn't broken.

There are 2 main ways to play the game:

1) offense - buy blocks and bridge to enemy bases to break their bed and eliminate them
2) defense - stay at your base and put blocks around your bed which make it much harder to break

IRON
--------------
The island you spawn on is an iron island, which is also your base. Iron is the most plentiful resource in the game, and is most useful in early game and for purchasing cheap items.

In early game, the most useful item you can buy with iron are glass blocks. Glass blocks will allow you to bridge to the other islands the quickest, as you can buy 16 of them for 5 iron.
This comes at the expense of glass being the most fragile block in the game, which makes bridging difficult if someone is breaking your blocks.
With iron you can buy:
1) Glass, cheap and plentiful block, which comes at the expense of its integrity.
2) Grass, A unique, semi-strong block which is unaffected by the pickaxe and axe.
3) Wooden Sword, the "best" weapon in the game, dealing 2 hearts of damage per hit. Ideal for early game.
4) Fireball, a powerful projectile which explodes upon contact, destroying blocks and dealing damage to players on a direct hit.

Iron is a very plentiful resource, which allows you to buy alot with it.

Once you have 5 iron, open the shop and buy glass.


**SHOP**
--------------
To open the shop, click [B] to toggle it on and off.
Once you have enough resources, click on an item which is lit up to buy it. (hint: you can see the resources you have at top left!)

Some items cannot be bought with iron, you will have to bridge out to the other islands to gain different resources.

**BRIDGING**
--------------
To bridge to different islands, you will first need blocks.
Once you have atleast 16 blocks, you can start briding to the gold island. (the island closest to you)

1) Hold shift, and go over the edge of the island. (you won't fall!) 
2) keep holding shift, and put the crosshair on the side of the block you are standing on, then right click.

3) repeat this until you are out of blocks

EMERALDS
--------------
You can buy better items with the other resources you collected, but nothing beats emeralds, so the emerald island should be your next briding location.

With emeralds you can buy:
1) Enderpearl, a projectile that will teleport you to its point of impact.
2) Obsidian, the strongest block in the game, ideal for defending your bed.
3) Emerald Sword, the best weapon in the game, dealing 4 hearts of damage per hit.

Emeralds are the best resource in the game, so expect players to be there before you!


This tutorial covers the basics of my game, but there are many more aspects which you will have to learn yourself, so that you can be the ultimate player.
**Have fun playing Bedwars!**
