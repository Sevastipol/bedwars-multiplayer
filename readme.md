[ 2 PEOPLE REQUIRED TO START ]
Heavily inspired by Minecraft Bedwars.

In bedwars, you spawn on your own island, and have to gather resources from resource generators to buy items in the shop. You will have to spend resources on blocks to bridge out to other islands for even better resources. Buy items to eliminate others and to protect your bed, as you can only respawn if your bed isn't broken.
